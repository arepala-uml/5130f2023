                            INTERNET AND WEB SYSTEMS â€“ I
                                PROJECT WEEK - 1

Summary:

I am most proud of that I have completed the basic webpage development needed for our application.In this weeek, 
I mostly worked on implementing webpages for our DietFit application. Firstly, I worked on developing
the home page for our application where it contains the information regarding the importance of food, understanding calories,
eating healthy food and role of healthy food for good health. These are the minimum information where the user has to know
before checking the BMI and getting the diet plan. As DietFit is user friendly app, I added a user details page where the
user can enter his details like height, weight, age, gender and user can click on submit button. After giving the user details,
our plan is to display the users BMI and will ask for additional information. The requests from the app will be 
handled by a python flask server. The displaying BMI and asking for user related information like allergy towards food 
and we will be working in the next week. For now, we can run normally the html files and attached the steps for creating 
the virtual environment and running the flask server.
