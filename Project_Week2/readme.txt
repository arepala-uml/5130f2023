                                PROJECT WEEK - 2

Summary:

I am most proud of that I have completed the displying of BMI details based on the user information height, weight, 
age, and gender. Also, I worked on adding the other information details from user like allergy towards food after getting the BMI.
Also, we collected some information like food details based on the BMI.The DietFit app has incorporated new enhancements, including user authentication and MongoDB integration for expanded 
functionality. Now, user sessions are managed through Flask-Login to guarantee secure login and logout processes.
By utilizing flask-pyMongo module, the app interacts with MongoDB, ensuring smooth storage and retrieval of user data.
We need to install the necessary packages (Flask, Flask-PyMongo, Flask-Login) using pip and it is importantto set a 
secure SECRET_KEY in the app's configuration. Also, I added the new authenticated routes where users can securely login and 
logout. The BMI calculation is added and shown in the UI. For full functionality, ensure that MongoDB is running locally 
on the default port (27017). Also, we need to show the calorie recommendations based on the more user information like Favourite
food, favourite exercises and some other information. For now, we have written in the readme of how to run the files till now.
