                            INTERNET AND WEB SYSTEMS â€“ I
                                PROJECT WEEK - 3

Summary:

I am most proud of that I have completed the rendering of html pages from the flask server code. Also,I have
completed the BMI calculation part and displaying it on UI by taking inputs like height, weight,age and gender.
Also, I worked on adding a dedicated page where it allows users to input details such as preferred food items 
and exercises for their better health. The DietFit app now boasts a user-friendly interface for health and 
fitness tracking. The DietFit app has introduced new routes in the server to seamlessly render HTML files, 
enhancing the overall user experience. Recent enhancements include three main pages (home, user details, login), 
HTML rendering from the Flask server, and a BMI calculator with real-time display. An additional page allows users to input 
preferences for food and exercises. The default route has been configured to serve as the landing page by rendering the 
'home.html' template whenever user enters this in browser (http://localhost:9000/). The DietFit app now 
incorporates an API call function triggered whenever the "Calculate BMI" button is clicked. This function 
initiates a request to the 'calculate_bmi' route in the Flask server, enabling seamless interaction and dynamic 
BMI calculations based on user input. I modified the readme steps to see our changes.
