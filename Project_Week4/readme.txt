                                PROJECT WEEK - 4

Summary:

I am most proud of that I have completed the calculation of calorie intake based on the BMI. Also,
I have worked on adding a page where to take additional information such as favourite cuisine, 
food allergy details and comfortable exercises. Based on the user information, we were able to
display the diet and exercise plan in partial manner in the tabular format. Diet-Fit, the ultimate 
personalized health companion! Upon launching the app, users can input their culinary preferences, 
dietary choices, food allergies, and preferred exercises, ranging from cardio to calming yoga. 
Utilizing this information along with the Body Mass Index (BMI), Diet-Fit generates a 30-day diet 
plan displayed in an easy-to-follow table format. The plan accommodates diverse cuisines, dietary 
restrictions, and exercise routines, ensuring a holistic approach to wellness. The key features 
include BMI-based calorie calculations and ongoing updates for an evolving, tailored user 
experience. In the flas server side, we added logic to calcuate calorie intake based on BMI as well as
handled the rendering of new html page.
