                                PROJECT WEEK - 5

Summary:

I am most proud of that I have completed the storing of various food items data and exercises
details into the mongoDB. Also, I have added signup page and login page in which user can log into
our application and added the logic to create a user in mongoDB as well as validating the user data
during login. I have added a Exercise plan option same as diet plan based on user information.
When users access the application, they have the option to input their culinary preferences,
dietary preferences, any food allergies they may have, and their preferred exercises, 
spanning from cardio workouts to soothing yoga sessions. By leveraging this input, in conjunction 
with the Body Mass Index (BMI), Diet-Fit dynamically generates a well-structured 30-day diet plan 
and exercise plan in table format. Modified the readme steps for our application regarding installation
part of mongoDB.
