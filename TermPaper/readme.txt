            TITLE: A Survey on AWS Cloud Computing Security Challenges & Solutions


ABSTRACT:

Mainly, Amazon provides a wide range of IT solutions for businesses to create their private virtual clouds 
and maintain full control over their infrastructure. Amazon Web Services (AWS) can be used for both business operations and IT projects. 
While the cloud offers cost savings and efficiency that attract security professionals, it also raises various security and compliance concerns.
In response to these concerns, AWS has introduced EC2 instances to enhance security, especially for highly regulated companies.
Cloud computing has its drawbacks, but these drawbacks also offer opportunities to explore various cloud computing-related topics. 
One major concern is the security and privacy of data stored and processed on cloud service providers' servers.
This paper gave an analysis by reviewing several research papers and studies on cloud computing security and privacy, shedding light on the challenges and problems associated with it. 
Mainly this article aims to improve our understanding of cloud computing security issues and highlight the techniques and solutions employed by the cloud service industry. 
Ultimately, the paper's objective is to provide insights into the emerging cloud services market and the upcoming challenges, including issues related to networks.

CONCLUSION:

In this paper, the authors discussed different AWS services and their security measures, 
infrastructure security and security best practices. In recent years, cloud computing has 
witnessed remarkable growth, particularly in the realm of commercial online applications.
The on-demand, pay-as-you-go model has revolutionized access to computing capacity, 
offering a more flexible and cost-effective approach. Acquiring computing power has become 
remarkably straightforward. Cloud-based applications enable users to easily purchase products 
online, initiating and terminating virtual images as needed. Among the popular features of these 
services, sharing and creating virtual images with other users stand out. The ascendancy of 
cloud computing has facilitated comprehensive research into its various aspects, unveiling 
five primary characteristics, three service models, and four deployment methods. Examining 
secure cloud storage is intricate due to data being stored redundantly or across multiple 
locations within a chain of service providers.
